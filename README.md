# Example Uniform Base Project

This is an example project using [Uniform](https://hexdocs.pm/uniform/).

It currently is a facade that doesn't contain real functionality, but it serves
to demonstrate the structure of a Uniform base project and demonstrate what the
ejected repos will contain.

## Ejected Repos

  * Tweeter: https://github.com/ucbi/example_uniform_project_tweeter
  * Twadmin: https://github.com/ucbi/example_uniform_project_twadmin
